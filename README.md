## Instructor ##

My name is Ethan Brown. I'm a Weber State Alumni and a Site Reliability Engineer at Adobe.
I consider myself more of a python developer than C# but I enjoy working with it.

## Course Objectives ##

This is the official course description.

> This course is intended to teach students how to write Windows programs in C# using the .NET environment. The student will learn how to develop programs based on Windows Applications and the .NET Framework. They will also be introduced to APIs and MFC/AFX styles of Windows programming and to become familiar with various data sharing methods and .NET services.

My goal of this course will be for you to become better ENGINEERS. Not just a regurgitator of
facts and code snippets. I will be going over information about .NET so that you can pass your
Bachelor Assessment but for the most part I want this class to be about doing and less about note
taking.

## Book ##

The book is optional but it might be a useful reference. I will be using it to prepare
classroom lectures.

* Visual C# How to Program (6th Edition)

## Software ##

We will be using Visual Studio 2015+ and git. You may use the free community edition.
We will cover how to download it as well as git in class.

* Visual Studio 2015 or greater
* git
* VS Code (optional)
* WLS - Windows Linux Subsystem (optional)

## Course Fee ##

Course fees for the Computer Science major are designed to cover the costs of lab equipment
maintenance and replacement including desktop and server computer systems and software;
consumable materials and supplies; and support for lab aides, student tutors, and online
instructional resources.

## Assignments ##

The course will be broken up into 2 parts. The first part will consist of smaller
assignments that will be focused on learning general concepts of C# and Windows Applications
The second part will be focused on a final group project.

* Assignments will be given with plenty of time to complete
* I will allow time in class to work
* They will require time outside of class especially as they increase in scope and difficulty
* Late assignments will be incur a 10% penalty
* Anything turned in over a week late will be incur a 50% penalty
* If you are struggling to keep up talk to me ASAP. Don't wait until after assignments are due.
* You will use git to turn your code
* If you don't know git, don't panic! We will discuss how to use git in class and I will show you what you need know

## Asking Questions ##

Don't hesitate to ask questions. In this industry you have to be inquisitive, no matter how
"stupid" you think it is. The only thing that is stupid is making assumptions. Always clarify
and ask. There are 3 resources for asking questions.

1. In Class
2. Canvas Discussion Boards
3. direct email to me (only use this if it is a personal matter or urgent)

## Students With Disabilities ##

Any student requiring accommodations or services due to a disability must contact Services for
Students with Disabilities (SSD) in room 181 of the Student Services Center. SSD can also
arrange to provide course materials (including this syllabus) in alternative formats if necessary.

## Grading ##

    A = 93 - 100%
    A- = 90 - 92.9%
    B = 83 – 86.9%
    B+ = 87 – 89.9%
    B- = 80 – 82.9%
    C+ = 77 – 79.9%
    C = 73 – 76.9%
    C- = 70 – 72.9%
    D+ = 67 – 69.9%
    D = 63 – 66.9%
    D- = 60 – 62.9%
    E  = below 60%

## Schedule ##

The Schedule is a **ROUGH** outline of what we will cover. I reserve the right to adjust for
the class needs. My goal would be to finish up the topics earlier to allow more time for
the final project. I will be your guide through this and we will speed up and slow down as
needed.
